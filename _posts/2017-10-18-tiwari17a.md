title: Automatic Classification of Critical Findings in Radiology Reports
abstract: Communication of “actionable” findings in radiology reports is an important
  part of high quality medical care. Distinguishing radiology reports with “actionable”
  findings from other reports is currently a function of the radiologist and largely
  a manual process. This paper describes a system for automatic classification of
  patient’s radiology reports as it relates to the degree of severity of “actionable”
  findings provided by the radiology department at University of Massachusetts Medical
  School. This is done by using machine learning classifier on text based features.
  Several machine learning classification algorithms are evaluated and compared. Random
  forest classifier performed the best in this case while other classification methods
  also performed decently.
