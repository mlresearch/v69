title: An Integrated Database and Smart Search Tool for Medical Knowledge Extraction
  from Radiology Teaching Files
abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for an effective medical treatment.
  Teaching files are widely used by radiologists as a resource in the diagnostic process
  and to teach students of radiology. Teaching files contain images, recorded discussion
  and notes, external references, augmenting annotations, and patient history. Most
  hospitals maintain an active collection of teaching files for their internal purposes,
  but many publically available teaching files are available through online sources
  that typically provide a basic keyword search interface but little else that can
  help physicians find the most relevant examples. Other secondary sources (e.g.,
  journals or radiology textbooks) might also be referenced from a teaching file or
  provide an independent source of information; however, journal and textbook search
  capabilities, if available, can be very ad hoc and even more limited than for public
  teaching file repositories. Therefore, in order to access multiple resources, radiologists
  need to manually navigate each particular source and aggregate the search results
  into a full answer. In this paper, we describe our integration of multiple public
  data sources into a unified medical resource repository and the design of advanced
  search features that make it easier to find relevant teaching files as well as journals
  or textbooks. Our approach supports incorporating diverse public data that can be
  further combined with a hospitalâ€™s in-house teaching files to provide an integrated
  radiological knowledge repository. We tested our Integrated Radiological Image Search
  (IRIS) engine using a set of representative queries. Our search engine finds more
  accurate and relevant results compared to search engines available for public data
  sources. The IRIS engine is tailored to facilitate understanding of natural language
  queries, including negation statements, synonym terms, adjectives, and different
  sources of text. In addition, the search engine is designed to allow further integration
  of a module for image-based search to allow finding of visually similar cases.
