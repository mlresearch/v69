title: Predicting Annual Length-Of-Stay and its Impact on Health
abstract: Avoidable hospitalizations are a source of increased health expenditures
  in many health systems. Prolonged length of stay is costly for providers, insurers,
  and patients to the extent it is associated to higher health service consumption
  and to the development of endangering states during the hospital stay. In this article
  we use machine learning techniques to predict annual patient length-of-stay in Colombiaâ€™s
  statutory health care system and measure its impact on health costs by estimating
  the potential cost savings of a hospitalization prevention program. Results from
  the predictive modeling show tree-based methods outperform linear approximations
  and achieve lower out-of-sample error rates compared to the winning model of the
  Heritage Health Prize. We also show that a prevention program where patient intervention
  is decided upon the predictions of the model can achieve significant cost savings
  relative to the best uniform policy (i.e, intervene all patients or no intervention).
  This holds for program efficacies greater than 40% and intervention costs per patient
  ranging between 100,000 and 700,000 Colombian pesos.
