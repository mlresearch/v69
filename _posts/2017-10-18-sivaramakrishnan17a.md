title: Visualizing Deep Learning Activations for Improved Malaria Cell Classification
abstract: Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the parasites transmitted
  through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. Thick and thin film microscopic
  examinations of blood smears are the most commonly used and reliable methods for
  diagnosis, however, its accuracy depends on the smear quality and human expertise
  in classifying the normal and parasitemic cells. Manual examination can be burdensome
  for large-scale diagnoses in endemic regions resulting in poor quality, unnecessary
  medication, leading to severe economic impact to the individual health program.
  Automated malaria screening using machine learning techniques, such as deep learning,
  offers the promise of serving as an effective diagnostic aid. In this study, we
  propose the advantages offered through visualizing the features and activations
  in a simple, customized deep learning model. We apply it to the challenge of malaria
  cell classification, and as a result the model achieves 98.61% classification accuracy
  with lower model complexity and computation time. It is found to considerably outperform
  the state of the art including other pre-trained deep learning models.
